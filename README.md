# Chatbot-Project

## Introduction

Meet Chatty! She will assist you with anything you might need regarding your online order!

Within online shopping, one of the main drawbacks is people who are scared any issues might occur after they have placed an online order.
This is why it is important to have a strong customer service team. Chatty acts as a first-line defence for customer service agents, getting rid of any small questions and requests so that agents have time to focus on important issues.

## Technical aspects

Chatty was trained on a series of patterns of how a person would ask a question about a certain topic. Each topic has its owns patterns and also appropriate replies.
She was trained with deep learning using Tensor Flow and currently, she can reply to roughly 27 different types of interactions.
Another feature included is a sentiment analysis on each user input, which will determine what kind of reply she will provide.

And finally, the analytics page will give an overview of how she is performing, allowing for constant improvement on the model.

## Getting Started

There are too important files to use Chatty:

    - The 'Data set + model training' contains the training data and model
    - The 'website' contains the flask that will run the website where the chatbot is built

There is already a trained model included so there is no need to use the first file.
Simply run the 'website' python file and you should be able to use Chatty.

To access the Analytics page, click the "Employee page" button, use 'santos.123' as a user and '12345' as a password.
This will grant you access to the final page.

# Enjoy!
